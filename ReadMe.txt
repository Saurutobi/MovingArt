Have a bunch of Digital art? Want to display it? This RaspberryPi solution will do just that for you.

What you'll need:

A Monitor or TV with HDMI input.
A RaspberryPi specB.
An HDMI Cable.
A Wall Wart to power your Raspberry Pi.
A power strip with at least 2 3-pronged sockets.
A household 3-pronged power socket.
A Relay board what supports AC120V 10A.

Soldering Iron.
Solder.
Basic electronics hobbyist tools.


Basic setup(There are detailed schematics and a how-to video included).
Note-Be careful, while working, never have any power connected. Stay safe, my friends.

1.Wall power will supply the power strip.
2.Power Strip will supply wall wart and single socket. 
3.Splice into the second port to get Positive, Negative, and Ground.
4.Connect the Positive wire directly to the single Socket.
5.Connect the Ground wire directly to the single socket.
6.Connect the Negative wire to the input on your relay board.
7.Connect A second wire to the output on your relay board. Connect this wire to the single socket's ground terminal.
